## Overview

  This one was kinda tricky since I've never used image hover effects... Still trying to figure out how to scale down the view icon and add thecyan color to the hover effect. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this one! My first late night challenge xD

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
